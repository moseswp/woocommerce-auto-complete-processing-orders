#Automatically completes orders with a status of "processing" in WooCommerce.

Step 1: Activate the Plugin:
Go to your WordPress dashboard.
Navigate to Plugins > Installed Plugins.
Find WooCommerce Auto Complete Processing Orders and click Activate.

How It Works:
The plugin hooks into WooCommerce's woocommerce_payment_complete_order_status filter.
When an order moves to "processing" status, it automatically changes the status to "completed."
Orders with any other status remain unaffected.
By activating this plugin, all "processing" orders will now automatically be marked as completed without any manual intervention!
